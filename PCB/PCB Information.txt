This PCB was designed in KiCAD and went through a few revisions, in part due to issues with supply on components in 2021/2022.  Most of the parts are readily available still, however you may struggle to find the parts for the 3.3v power supply, these were constantly appearing and dropping out of availability.  The RC522 boards are available but quality of these varies a lot, with some simply not being viable for reading anything other than the most basic MiFare Classic clone cards.  Some details about how to improve some modules is available here https://trikkitt.com/rfid-rc522-rfid-reader-modules-why-they-dont-work-and-how-to-fix-them/ but be aware some are so bad they can't be fixed.  I had to bin around 20 modules as a result.  While it mentioned the DFR299 audio modules there are very cheap clones available that I ended up using to keep costs down.  The tamper switches are optional, if you aren't going to use them either remove the code that monitors them, or link them out.  If you only need one then make sure you link the other one out or you will get problems!
